## Introduction

The **Virtue Assessment Application** is a personal development tool designed to help individuals evaluate themselves daily on various virtues based on ancient Roman values. Users can rate themselves on virtues such as Auctoritas, Dignitas, and Pietas using an easy-to-use graphical interface. The application allows users to track their progress over time and view monthly statistics in the form of line graphs.

## Features

- Daily self-assessment using sliders for 40+ virtues.
- Descriptions provided for each virtue to guide users in their assessment.
- Data is saved locally in a CSV file for easy tracking.
- Monthly statistics presented as line graphs to visualize progress.
- Simple, clean, and scrollable user interface using `Tkinter`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Required Python libraries:
  - `tkinter`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtue-assessment-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd virtue-assessment-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   You can install the required libraries using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```

   Note: `Tkinter` is typically included with Python on most systems. If you encounter any issues, refer to your operating system's instructions for installing Tkinter.

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. **Launch the Application**:
   In the project directory, run the following command to start the application:
   ```bash
   python virtue_assessment.py
   ```

   The GUI window will open, displaying sliders for each virtue along with their descriptions.

### Submitting Ratings

2. **Submit Daily Ratings**:
   - Adjust the sliders to rate yourself on each virtue (1 to 10).
   - After setting your ratings, click the **Submit Ratings** button to save the data for that day.
   - The ratings are stored in a CSV file named `virtue_ratings.csv` in the same directory.

### Viewing Statistics

3. **View Monthly Statistics**:
   - Enter the month and year in the input fields.
   - Click the **Show Line Graph for Month** button to generate a line graph of your ratings for each virtue across the selected month.

   The graph will display your daily progress for all virtues rated during that month.

## Data Storage

The data is stored locally in a CSV file (`virtue_ratings.csv`). The file contains the following columns:

- **Date**: The date of the rating submission (in `YYYY-MM-DD` format).
- **Virtue Name**: Each virtue has its own column containing the rating (from 1 to 10) given for that day.

This CSV file can be easily imported into spreadsheet software or analyzed further using Python or other tools.
